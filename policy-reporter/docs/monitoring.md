# Kyverno Monitoring

Monitor [Kyverno policy metrics](https://kyverno.io/docs/monitoring/) with Prometheus

## Introduction

As a cluster administrator, it may benefit you to have monitoring capabilities over both the state and execution of cluster-applied Kyverno policies. This includes monitoring over any applied changes to policies, any activity associated with incoming requests, and any results produced as an outcome. If enabled, monitoring will allow you to visualize and alert on applied policies, and is critical to overall cluster observability and compliance.

In addition, you can specify the scope of your monitoring targets to either the rule, policy, or cluster level, which enables you to extract more granular insights from collected metrics.


## Installation

The instructions below are for deploying kyverno reporting in a BigBang cluster with monitoring and kyverno packages enabled.

Note: At the time of writing, IB approved image for Kyverno is not available. As such, if kyvernopolicies package is also deployed in the BigBang Cluster, the restrict-image-registries policy needs to be updated to allow images to be sourced from ghrc.io repository.

```
kyvernopolicies:
  values:
    policies:
      restrict-image-registries:
        parameters:
          allow:
          - ghcr.io
```

Note that Big Bang is setup to add your overrides to the default value (registry1.dso.mil) 

Execute the installation steps as mentioned in [overview](./overview.md) document. Ensure that the following values are used to turn on monitoring:


```
monitoring:
  enabled: true
  namespace: monitoring
  grafana:
    namespace: monitoring
```
   
## Kyverno Metrics 

### Policies and Rule Counts

#### Metric Name: kyverno_policy_rule_info_total

#### Metric Type: Gauge

0 - if the rule is not anymore present in the cluster (although it was created in the past).

1 - if the rule is currently actively present in the cluster.

This metric can be used to track the number of policies as well as rules present in the cluster which are currently active and even the ones which are not currently active but were created in the past.

### Policy and Rule Execution

#### Metric Name: kyverno_policy_results_total

#### Metric Type: Counter

An only-increasing integer representing the number of results/executions associated with the rule corresponding to a metric sample.

This metric can be used to track the results associated with the rules executing as a part of incoming resource requests and even background scans. This metric can be further aggregated to track policy-level results as well.

### Policy Rule Execution Latency

#### Metric Name: kyverno_policy_execution_duration_seconds

#### Metric Type: Histogram

A float value representing the latency of the ruleâ€™s execution in seconds.

This metric can be used to track the latencies associated with the execution/processing of the individual rules whenever they evaluate incoming resource requests or execute background scans. This metric can be further aggregated to present latencies at the policy-level.

### Policy Change Counts

#### Metric Name: kyverno_policy_changes_total

#### Metric Type: Counter

An only-increasing integer representing the total number of policy-level changes associated with a metric sample.

This metric can be used to track the history of all Kyverno policy-related changes such as policy creations, updates, and deletions.

### Admission Review Latency

#### Metric Name: kyverno_admission_review_duration_seconds

#### Metric Type: Histogram

This metric can be used to track the end-to-end latencies associated with the entire individual admission review, corresponding to the incoming resource request triggering a bunch of policies and rules.

### Admission Requests Counts

#### Metric Name: kyverno_admission_requests_total

#### Metric Type: Counter

This metric can be used to track the number of admission requests which were triggered as a part of Kyverno.

## Prometheus Dashboard

Port forward the kube-prometheus service as follows:

```
kubectl -n monitoring port-forward service/monitoring-monitoring-kube-prometheus 9090:9090
```

Navigate to Prometheus Dashboard at http://localhost:9090/

The metrics are sourced from Kyverno endpoints that can be verified by targets at http://localhost:9090/targets

serviceMonitor/kyverno/kyverno-kyverno-svc-service-monitor/0

serviceMonitor/policy-reporter/policy-reporter-monitoring/0

## Grafana

Port forward the grafana service as follows:

```
kubectl -n monitoring port-forward service/monitoring-monitoring-grafana  3000:80
```

Navigate to Grafana Dashboard at http://localhost:3000/

Verify that Prometheus datasource is setup by navigating to the following url. This datasource is automatic created when monitoring is enabled in BigBang installation.

http://localhost:3000/datasources

### Policy Report Dashboards

Search for Policy Report dashboards by navigating to the following url and enter Policy as search term.

http://localhost:3000/datasources?search=open

This results in dashboards tagged with Policy Reporter
